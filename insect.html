            <h3>What are insect-borne diseases?</h3>
            <p>Insect-borne diseases are viral and bacterial illnesses caused by insect bites. The most common insects that pass on diseases are mosquitoes, sand flies, ticks, and fleas. For example, mosquitoes spread the Zika virus, Yellow Fever, and Malaria. Ticks are known to spread Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever.</p>

            <h3>What causes insect-borne diseases?</h3>
            <p>These diseases are caused by blood-sucking insects that infect humans through bites. The risk of infection increases in areas where these insects gather, such as tall grass, bushes, stagnant water, forests, and areas with active outbreaks.</p>
